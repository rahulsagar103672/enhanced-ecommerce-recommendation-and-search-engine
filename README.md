This project implements a hybrid ecommerce search and recommendation engine combining:

BM25 for term-based ranking
Fuzzy Matching for handling misspellings and approximate search
Semantic Embeddings for context-aware search and recommendations
Multilingual Search support for diverse user queries
Spell Correction using SymSpell
Fuzzy Relevance Scoring & Semantic Similarity to improve product retrieval accuracy


✨ Features
Hybrid Search Engine: Combines BM25, fuzzy matching, and semantic search
Multilingual Search: Users can search in different languages
Spell Correction: Uses SymSpell to correct user queries
Fuzzy Matching: Helps find relevant products even with typos
Semantic Similarity: Embeddings help retrieve products based on meaning rather than just keywords
Personalized Recommendations: Context-aware product recommendations based on search history
🛠 Technologies Used
BM25 (for ranking documents)
Fuzzy Matching (handling misspellings and variations)
SymSpell (spell correction)
Sentence Transformers (semantic embeddings)
FastAPI / Flask (for API development)


🏆 Future Improvements
🔍 Improve search relevance with user behavior tracking
📊 Implement real-time analytics for search trends
